# FAILURES.md — VesperLM failure log and fallback tree

Standing directive (user, 2026-10-09): **never stop on failure.** Document it,
learn from it, try the next method. Every failed experiment gets an entry here
within one heartbeat of detection, and the next alternative gets queued in the
same cycle. Failures are results — a clean falsification saves more money than
a lucky pass.

## Entry template

```
## <date> — <experiment id> — <one-line claim that failed>
- Evidence: <result file / log path, key numbers>
- Root cause: <best understanding; "unknown" is acceptable, guessing is not>
- What it rules out: <the branch of design space now closed>
- Next tried: <which fallback was queued and why>
```

## Fallback tree — self-learning / modular architecture line

If a rung fails, document, then take the NEXT untried branch — cheapest first.
Do not retry a falsified method unchanged.

**Passport routing (domain experts)**
1. PassportRouter + D55 sequential insertion (current; validated 11M/120M)
2. If purity weakens at scale: cosine scoring + learned temperature; prototype
   (Arrow-style) passport init; per-tier owner_mass/reject_w schedule
3. If passports fail outright: BTX-style shared-lineage branching only
   (sacrifice third-party plug-ins), or PEER-style product-key routing with
   tiny experts (sacrifice expert size)
4. If MoE plug-in fails entirely: LoRA adapter library + retrieval router
   (weakest modularity, but proven to work everywhere)

**Episodic memory as experts (MODULAR_MOE.md §8, gates G1-G4)**
1. Contract-expert consolidation via D55 (current design)
2. If G1 (retention parity) fails: keep direct-edit Hippocampus for fast
   weights, use experts only for long-term consolidation (hybrid cadence)
3. If G2 (zero-shot reachability) fails: accept router recalibration per
   insert (slower loop, design survives); or sidecar kNN-retrieval over
   episode embeddings feeding context (no weight change at all)
4. If G3 (N=16 coexistence) fails: cap the live library, archive stale
   experts to NVMe offload with prototype-index reinsertion; or hierarchical
   passports (domain passport -> memory passport, two-stage routing)
5. If G4 (live loop at t3) fails on hardware: consolidation on a second
   machine over LAN (the P40 box), serving never blocks

**Live self-learning (no train/inference boundary)**
1. Talk -> buffer -> idle-time expert consolidation (current)
2. If consolidation is too slow: online LoRA with EWC-style importance
   penalty (proven continual-learning method, less modular)
3. If weight updates are too fragile: pure retrieval memory (RAG over
   episode store) + in-context distillation prompts — no learning in weights,
   but unbreakable; use as the safety floor while weights-side methods mature
4. If router-based addressing fails: cross-attention sidecar memory network
   (memory tokens appended per layer, trained with spine frozen)

**Rules**
- One variable changes per experiment; confounded results get reruns, not
  stories.
- Scale ladder is mandatory: t0 falsifies before t1 spends, t1 before t2,
  t2 before droplet money. Never skip a tier because a result "looks obvious".
- Every fallback taken is recorded here with the evidence that forced it.
- The user is only interrupted for budget or architecture-direction
  decisions; everything else is autonomous.
